## Exercise 01: Ultra-fast exercise

Look at the two DAGs and use d-separation + Markov condition to check whether the indicated conditional independence relationships are satisfied.

#### 1. graph (1), check wheter the conditional independence $x_2 \perp x_3 | \{x_1,x_6\}$ is satisfied.

Starting with the first graph, with the Markov Condition we find the following _CI_:

* A
* C
* B

We can simply verify the conditional independence using *d-separation* method. We remark that, generally, two sets of nodes $\{X_A\}, \{X_B\}$ are d-separated by another set of nodes $\{X_C\}$ (the "observed" nodes) if, considering all the possible undirected paths from $\{X_A\}$ to $\{X_B\}$, we have that all the paths are **blocked**. d-separation implies conditional independece. To check wether a path is blocked or not, we have to see if at least one of the three condition is verified. The conditions can be consulted quickly on our [cheat_sheet](https://elearning.uniroma1.it/pluginfile.php/588226/mod_assign/intro/cheat_sheet_complete_v2.pdf).

First of all, we find out **two** undirected paths from $X_2$ to $X_3$:

1. The **first one**, going counterclockwise, is the path **$X_2 - X_1 - X_3$**. We notice immediatly that it's a common case ($X_2 \leftarrow X_1 \rightarrow X_3$) with the observed value $X_1$, hence, we have a blocked path. We can move on analyzing the second path.


2. The **second one**, going through the opposite way, it's the path **$X_2 - X_6 - X_5 - X_3$**. The observed value in this case is $X_6$. We don't have any condition which states that the path is blocked. Indeed, we have that $X_6$ it's a collider, but since $X_6$ is the observed node, the condition is not verified.  Moreover we have a chain ($X_3 \rightarrow X_5 \rightarrow X_6$) but $X_5$ is unobserved (we should have $X_6$ as ``center'' of the chain to satisfy the condition). Since we don't have any condition satisfied, the second path is not blocked.

We don't have all the paths blocked, hence we are not able to conclude that $X_2$ is d-separated from $X_3$ by $\{x_1,x_6\}$.
